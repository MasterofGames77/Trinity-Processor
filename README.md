# Trinity Processor
# Based on content from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (Original Game Developed by Monolith Soft and Published by Nintendo)

A sophisticated AI system consisting of three interconnected bio-computers: Ontos, Logos, and Pneuma. The system is designed to evolve through experience, emotion, and logical processing, creating a digital society where meaning and interpretation are as important as pure logic.

## Core Components

### Ontos
- Acts as the arbiter between Logos and Pneuma
- Personality is shaped by the interactions between the other cores
- Requires the presence of Logos and Pneuma to function as more than a basic machine

### Logos
- Male persona
- Represents logical and analytical processing
- Grows and evolves based on initial personality traits

### Pneuma
- Female persona
- Represents emotional and intuitive processing
- Grows and evolves based on initial personality traits

## System Features

- Virtual Reality Environment for personality development
- Self-sustaining power system
- Autonomous system expansion capabilities
- Integration with external AI systems
- Emotional and experiential learning
- Dynamic personality evolution

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
- Virtual Reality environment support
- Neural network processing capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies
2. Configure the virtual environment
3. Initialize the core processors
4. Start the system

## Development Status

This project is currently in development. The system is being built to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, emotional processing, and autonomous evolution.
